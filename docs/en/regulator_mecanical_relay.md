```yaml linenums="1"
packages:
  regulator:
    url: https://github.com/XavierBerger/Solar-Router-for-ESPHome/
    files:
      - path: solar_router/regulator_mecanical_relay.yaml
        vars:
          relay_regulator_gate_pin: GPIO22
```

This package require the definition of pin connected to the gate of the relay. Set `relay_regulator_gate_pin` into `vars` according to your hardware
