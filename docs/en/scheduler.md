# Scheduler

A *scheduler* is designed to perform automation directly via EspHome, to be more robust in the event of loss of connection with HomeAssistant, for example.

Each *scheduler* exposes controls to customize the automation to your needs from the HomeAssistant interface.

The first example is to enable forced load operation during off-peak hours.
